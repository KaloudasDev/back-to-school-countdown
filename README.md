Designed with modern UI/UX principles and smooth animations, this web app helps students and parents keep track of the days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until school starts, alongside a dynamic progress bar and calendar integration.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Back to School Countdown Timer** is a responsive, dark-themed web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. It features a live countdown to a fixed target date (school opening day), a progress bar showing the year’s progress, and a convenient "Add to Calendar" button to save the event effortlessly.

This lightweight tool is perfect for educational websites, personal blogs, or school portals seeking an engaging way to remind users about the approaching school start date.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. The countdown calculates the time difference between the current date and the predefined school opening date (September 11, 2025, 9:00 AM).
2. The progress bar reflects the elapsed percentage of the full academic year starting from the previous school opening date (September 11, 2024).
3. The countdown numbers animate whenever they update, providing a smooth and dynamic user experience.
4. When the countdown reaches zero, the headline changes to indicate the school year has started.
5. Users can click the **Add to Calendar** button to export the school start event to their personal calendar apps.
